There’s something almost magical about how Transformers understand human language. Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured a lot of attention (pun intended), especially with breakthroughs like OpenAI’s GPT-2 and ChatGPT. Recently, during a research meeting, my colleague shared something really interesting: she borrowed slides from another lab member who had presented on how language models work, and then walked her parents through it. To her surprise, by the end, they had a pretty solid understanding of how all this "magic" happens. Inspired by that, I want to take you behind the scenes of how these models operate, breaking it down in a way that's easy to grasp, even for those with no background in the field.

### Timeline and Foundational Context
To truly understand how a Large Language Model works, it’s essential to first explore the events that led to the development of the Transformer architecture by Google Research in 2017. [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03762), the groundbreaking paper behind this innovation, marked a pivotal shift in natural language processing. Prior to the Transformer, we relied on earlier techniques like Bag of Words and Word2Vec, which laid the groundwork for understanding language in computational terms. While these methods were valuable, they lacked the ability to capture the nuanced relationships between words and sentences as effectively as the Transformer does today. However, understanding these earlier methods is key to appreciating how far we’ve come in language AI.
