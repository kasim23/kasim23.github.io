There’s something almost magical about how Transformers understand human language. Over the past few years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have captured a lot of attention, especially with breakthroughs like OpenAI’s GPT-2 and ChatGPT. Recently, during a research meeting, my colleague shared something really interesting: she borrowed slides from another lab member who had presented on how language models work, and then walked her parents through it. To her surprise, by the end, they had a pretty solid understanding of how all this "magic" happens. Inspired by that, I want to take you behind the scenes of how these models operate, breaking it down in a way that's easy to grasp, even for those with no background in the field.
